# Portfolio Website README

## Process

The development of my portfolio website started with a clear goal in mind: to showcase my skills in a professional and appealing way. I began by sketching out a basic wireframe, outlining the general layout and components such as the navbar, hero section, services, and contact area. 

I opted for Bootstrap for responsive design to ensure accessibility across different devices. This decision was driven by Bootstrap's comprehensive components and utilities that speed up the development process. The animate.css library was incorporated to add subtle animations, enhancing the user experience without overwhelming the content.

## Challenges 

### Responsive Design
Ensuring the website looked good on all devices was a significant challenge. Bootstrap's grid system helped.


### Navigation Consistency
Maintaining a consistent and functional navigation across different pages initially posed a problem, especially when managing active states based on the current page.
